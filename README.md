# buildABear

## Overview of Project: 
In the Build A Bear project, we were assigned to create an application in which the user is able to dress a stuffed teddy bear in various outfits, including accessories, clothing items, and hats, and different types of backgrounds. The user is also able to name their outfit and then save it. The saved outfits would populate on the right-hand side of the screen so that the user can access them later. Although this project has a light-hearted, fun side to it, there are quite a few complicated challenges lying under the hood that this team had to work through. 

## Reflection: 
For the Build A Bear project, there was a minimal focus on HTML and CSS - we made sure to get the styling out of the way within the first two days because the reality of this project is that the main focus was on JavaScript functionality. Some of the main JavaScript themes involved in this project were use of objects, local storage, and a firm understanding of the relationship between the Data Model and the DOM. One of the major challenges we faced was implementing local storage - we spent a long time attempting to understand this concept and apply it to our project. We eventually were able to make sense of it but it was most certainly challenging. Another challenge we faced was that we were having duplicate cards for outfits being created, rather than one card simply being updated with changes. In terms of wins - we were able to make it through all of the required iterations of this project! We are very proud to have completed and submitted a finished Build A Bear with high levels of functionality.
